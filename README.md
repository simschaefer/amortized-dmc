# Amortized Bayesian Workflow of the Diffusion Model for Conflict Tasks

This repository contains the work of Schaefer et al. (2025). 

We propose a **generalized Amortized Bayesian Workflow** to yield optimal performance in the parameter estimation of cognitive models as well as pretrained networks for Amortized Bayesian Inference of the **Diffusion Model for Conflict Tasks** (Ulrich et al., 2015).

## üìÅ Repository Structure

* **`dmc/`**

  Includes the simulator function `DMC()` in `dmc_simulator.py` as well as helper functions to fit empirical data in `dmc_helpers.py`
  
* **`empirical_data/`**
  
  Includes data from the experiment seperately for each spacing condition:
    * Narrow spacing: `experiment_data_narrow.csv`
    * Wide spacing: `experiment_data_wide.csv`

    
* **`model_specs/`**

  Stored information about training hyperparameters, network hyperparameters and simulator specifications used for the training of all networks. The names correspond with those of the pretrained networks.

* **`notebooks/`**

  Comprehensive examples for
  
  * Running automated hyperparameter optimization using `optuna`
  * Training new networks
  * Apply pretrained networks to empirical data

* **`optuna_results/`**

  Results from the **Hyperparameter Optimization** Phase using `scripts/dmc_optuna.py`.
  
* **`training/`**

  Includes the scripts used in the **Training Phases** to train all four networks based on either initial or updated priors and either including or excluding trial-to-trial variability of the non-decision time.

* **`training_checkpoints/`**

  Includes the checkpoints of the trained networks for each condition.
  
* **`plot_scripts/`**

  All scripts that were used to create the plots in the paper:
  
  * `prior_predictive_check.py`: **Prior Predictive Checks** of initial and updated priors against empirical data.
  
  * **In Silico Evaluation** Phase:
  
    * `diagnostics.py`: computation of Recovery, Simulation-Based Calibration and Posterior Contraction for a fixed number of trials.
    * `metrics_num_obs.py`: computation of all in silico metrics for a varying number of trials between 50 and 1000.
  
  * **Application to Empirical Data** Phase:
    * `experimental_effects.py`: computation of standardized mean differences between experimental conditions (narrow vs. wide stimuli spacing)

    * `posterior_predictive_check.py`: Posterior Predictive Checks of individual RT and Accuracy Data, as well as correlation between mean RT, RT quantiles and mean accuracy.
    * `posterior_predictive_check_delta_functions.py`: Posterior Predictive Check of individual delta functions.
    * `posterior_reliability.py`: Split-Half correlation between individual parameter estimates for seven data sets.

  
  
* **`scripts/`**

  Additional scripts:
  
  * `dmc_optuna.py`: automated hyperparameter optimization
  * `prior_updating.py`: updating of priors in the **Prior Updating** Phase using the networks trained on initial priors
  * `simulate_data.py`: data simulation used in the **Benchmarking** Phase
